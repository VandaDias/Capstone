# Capstone Project - Next Word Predictor

This folder contains all the files needed to build a predictive text model for the Data Science Specialisation capstone project.


The database files are not in the folder due to their size. They can be downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip

The code to the model is split into two parts:

- "Create DFMs_2" where the searching databases are created, and

- "Model_2b" where the word search is undertaken


The web application code shares the files: "ui.R" and "server.R"

The data product presentation code is named "Model_Presentation_2.Rmd"
